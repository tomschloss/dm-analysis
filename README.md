# dm-analysis

Analysis for the coursera Strategic Business Analytics Capstone project.

## Dataset

This uses data from the KDD 98 Cup: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup98/kddcup98.html. The data is direct marketing data from the NGO Paralyzed Veterans of America.

## Pain point

Direct marketing is expensive and needs to be accurately targeted to maximise profits. This means sending mail to the people likely to donate and not to those who do not donate.
